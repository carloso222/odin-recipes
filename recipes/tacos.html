    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Tacos al Pastor</strong> are a beloved Mexican classic featuring thinly sliced <strong>marinated pork</strong>. 
        The meat is seasoned with a blend of dried chilies, spices, and achiote, then slow-roasted on a vertical spit called a trompo. 
        Served on warm corn tortillas, they are traditionally topped with fresh onions, cilantro, and a signature slice of roasted 
        pineapple for the perfect balance of savory and sweet.</p> <br>
