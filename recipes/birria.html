    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Birria</strong> is a rich, flavorful <strong>Mexico</strong> stew traditionally made from goat meat (chivo), though today it is very commonly prepared with beef (res). 
        The meat is marinated in a complex adobo of dried chili peppers (like Guajillo and Ancho), garlic, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon, 
        then slow-cooked until it becomes incredibly tender and "fall-apart."</p>
        <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: 4–5 lbs of Beef Chuck, Short Ribs, or Shank</li>
        <li>Dried Chilis: Guajillo (for color) and Ancho (for richness).</li>
        <li>Liquids: Beef broth and Apple cider vinegar.</li>
        <li>Aromatics: Fresh Garlic and White onion.</li>
        <li>Herbs: Dried Mexican Oregano and Bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Warm Spices: Cinnamon, Cloves, Cumin, and Black pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Chilis: Remove the stems and seeds from the dried chilis. Toast them lightly in a pan for 1–2 minutes, then soak them in hot water for 15 minutes until soft.</li>
        <li>Make the Adobo: Blend the softened chilis with the onion, garlic, vinegar, and all the spices (cinnamon, cloves, cumin, oregano, ginger, and pepper). Strain the mixture through a sieve for a smooth sauce.</li>
        <li>Sear the Meat: Season the beef generously with salt. In a large pot with a little oil, sear the meat over medium-high heat until browned on all sides to lock in the flavor.</li>
        <li>Marinate & Simmer: Pour the blended adobo over the meat. Add the beef broth and bay leaves. Ensure the meat is completely submerged in the liquid.</li>
        <li>Cook Until Tender: Cover the pot and cook until the meat is "fall-apart" tender:
            <ul><li>Stovetop: 3–4 hours on low heat.</li>
                <li>Pressure Cooker: 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Slow Cooker: 8 hours on low.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Shred the Meat: Remove the meat from the pot and shred it using two forks. Discard any large bones or excess fat.</li>
        <li>Finish the Consomé: Taste the broth remaining in the pot and add more salt if needed. This is your consomé.</li>
        <li>Serve: Place the shredded meat in a bowl, pour the hot broth over it, and garnish with fresh onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.Serve: Place the shredded meat in a bowl, pour the hot broth over it, and garnish with fresh onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.</li>
